YouTube DownloaderðŸª„

Hey there, If you're tired of the online video buffering blues and want to keep your favorite YouTube videos at your fingertips, you're in for a treat. With this nifty Python script, you can download those videos faster and easily. Ngl, I created it for my personal use and later thought of sharing it. 

Getting the Magic Going:

Get your hands on the script â€“ you can clone it or just swipe the youtube_downloader.py file.
Make sure you've got Python3 and pytube on your playground (pip install pytube).
Pop open your terminal, navigate to where the script hangs out.
Type the magic words: python ytd.py
Feed the script a YouTube URL and your desired video quality.
Your video will land in MP4 format, right in the same spot.
And, there you go! Enjoy Your video.
